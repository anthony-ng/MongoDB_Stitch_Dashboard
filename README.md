# Sales Dashboard

1. Add Auth
2. Add the Receipts Collection
3. Set up Access Rules ()
4. Update APP ID, install mongodb-stitch & chance libraries from npm
5. Creating Simple API Access with Stitch (Pipeline & HTTP Service)
6. Create pipelines for the dashboard (AggregateToppings & SalesTimeline)
7. Adding Authentication

### Now, with these steps, weâ€™ve created a system where:
- Data can only be loaded using a special API key
- Authenticated users can view a realtime dashboad, but only have access to
specific, non-PII data
- A public API may be used to access a specific, aggregated subset of data
